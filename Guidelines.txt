GOAL

The goal for this program is to create a text-based version of an old game concept called Autumn's Realm,
using text descriptions but using buttons for player interaction. The game should begin with the player
choosing the type of character they would like to play, rolling random statistic scores, and applying those
scores to attributes for their character, and then being told an introduction around having arrived in a town
seeking help with some lost villagers. The game will proceed through identifying what happened to the villagers,
deciding what to do about the missing villagers, and doing things to resolve the issues. The game needs combat
mechanics and combats the player should face, but also some level of player agency in determining what actions
to take in resolving the story.

MECHANICS NEEDED
Attack mechanics: Player should be able to attack monsters and monsters should be able to attack them. A roll
needs to be made to determine how well the attack is executed.

Defense mechanics: Player should have a defense score of some form which an attack must overcome in order to
receive damage and vice versa with monsters.

Heal mechanics: Players and possibly some monsters should have mechanics for restoring hit points.

Stat increase mechanics: Players should receive stat increases at appropriate time which change their ability
to succeed at attacks.

Negotiate mechanics: Players should have a way to negotiate with game characters and/or monsters to try and
convince characters/monsters to act in ways that benefit the player.

Save mechanics: Players should be able to save their game and reload their game at a later time to play further.
